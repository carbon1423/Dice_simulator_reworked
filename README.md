# Dice Simulator Reworked
 - A complete remake of Dice Simulator
 - Programmed in C/C++
## Goals
 - Render a standard set of Dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20)
 - Use OpenGL and GLFW to create a small window in which you can roll the dice
## Current Progress:
 - All dice rendering
 - Dice roll, but do not reposition back to a face
## Todo
 - Implement the custom dice
 - Make dice snap back to a face after rolling
 - Recolor/change looks
 - Currently very bare bones looking
